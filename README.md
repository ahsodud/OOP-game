## OOP game
As part of my uni assighment implement a simple tactical round-based game where two players
compete in claiming the most amount of tiles on a grid-based map.

# Goals met in this assighment
- Classes:
    - attributes, methods
    - constructor, copy constructor, destructor
- Strings & streams:
    - std::string
    - files
- Some data structures of the standard library:
    - e.g. std::vector
